## 📌 About the Project

**Spam Sense** is an AI-based desktop application that classifies text messages into:

- ✅ **Ham (Legitimate Message)**
- ❌ **Spam (Unwanted / Malicious Message)**

The application uses **ML.NET binary classification** to detect spam in real-time.

### 🎯 Problem Statement
Spam messages are a major issue in communication systems. Manually filtering them is inefficient and error-prone.

### 🎯 Objective
- Build a machine learning model using ML.NET  
- Integrate AI into a WinForms application  
- Provide real-time spam detection  
- Demonstrate Docker-based build process
